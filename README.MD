# Plexify
#### Port your Plex music playlists to Spotify

## Overview
This application will port a single Plex music playlist to your Spotify account.  There
's a fair amount of setup to do, but ultimately this will take you much, much, *much* less
 time than manually entering your Plex playlists into Spotify.

Run from the terminal or command prompt with:
 ```python plexify.py {playlist_name}```
 
 ### Walkthrough
 Assuming that you are starting at ground zero with not much technical knowledge about
  Python, Plex, or Spotify.  You will need to have Python installed on your computer.
  
  #### Download the code
  First thing, clone this github repository or download a zip of it. (More info on that
   [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/)).  Also
   , consider using a virtual environment for this. ([Why and How](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/))
   
   #### Install the required modules
   All of the required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
   
   *  In the terminal `cd` into the plexify directory.
 *  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 
 #### Fill in your credentials
 You will need credentials for both your Plex server and your Spotify account.  When
  you get them, enter them in the appropriate place in `credentials.py` (You can edit
   that file with any text editor.)
   
 ##### credentials.py
 `servername =` This is the name of the server your playlists live on.  
 
 `username = `  This is your Plex username
 
 `password = ` This is the password for your Plex account. *Please, please, please* use
  common sense here.  Don't put this file on a public computer.  I could have set
   prompts for all of these credentials but I felt that that would be too burdensome
   .  All the same, be careful with your credentials.  Thank you.
   
   `baseurl = ` Usually this is the local URL of your Plex server.  The default is
    `'http://127.0.0.1:32400'` and most people never change it.  If in doubt, use this.
    
 ##### Spotify Credentials
 You will need to get yourself a developer account at Spotify and register this
  application.  Super easy:
  1.  [Go here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and sign up.  They will issue
   you a client_id and a client_secret.  Copy those and paste them in the appropriate
    place in `credentials.py`
    
  2.  [Register Your App](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app)
  3.  In the settings for your app, pick any valid URL (example.com or google.com or
   anything at all) and add it to the RedirectURL field and enter the exact same value
    in `credentials.py`
    
    
 #### Run the app!
 `python plexify.py {playlist}` in the terminal where {playlist} is the name of your
  playlist **exactly** as it appears in Plex.  If it is more than one word or has
   special characters, wrap it in single quotes `'`.
   
 ####What happens next?
 *  The app will find your playlist in Plex.
 *  If your playlist has more than 100 items, the app will trim it to the first 100
  items because Spotify will only allow 100.
 *  For every track in your Plex playlist, the app will search Spotify for an exact match.
 *  As it loops through, you will be notified of every track that did not match.
 *  Once the loop is done, you will see a message:
    * `Matched x of y` `There were z un-matched`
 * You will then be given a choice to either (1) Not bother with trying to match or (2
 ) Trying to match in a different way.
 *  Choosing (1) will create a playlist on your Spotify account with the exact name as
  on Plex and fill it with the matched tracks of the first 100 on your Plex list.
  *  Choosing (2) will loop through all of the un-matched tracks
     *  You can choose from every album that your track's artist has on Spotify.  If
      you don't see the one you want or you're just fed up with the process, type `skip
      `, otherwise enter the number of your album.
      *  If you chose `skip`, you'll repeat the process with the next un-matched track
      *  If you choose an album number, you will be shown a list of every track on that
       album.  Enter the number of that track to add it to your playlist, or `skip` to
        move on to the next one.
      *  Once you've added or skipped all of the un-matched tracks, the app will create
       the playlist on your Spotify account
       
  ### Notes and Caveats
  *  The error handling in this app is pretty fragile.  Don't try to get too fancy.
  *  The more bootlegs, imports, and weird stuff you have in your playlists, the more
   un-matched tracks you'll get.
   *  If the code looks like it was written by a bumbling amateur...whatever, it works.
   *  `credentials.py` really should have been an .ini file.  I got lazy and it doesn't really make a big difference, just looks sloppy.
   
   ### Thank you
   I hope you find this application useful.
